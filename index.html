<p>I am a PhD student in particle astrophysics.

<p>My current work revolves around the <a href="https://nexo.llnl.gov/" title="nEXO homepage" target="_blank">nEXO experiment</a>, which aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in the isotope Xe-136. nEXO is made up of a large multi-national collaboration of scientists, and we work closely together to make <a href="#nexo" title="What is nEXO?" target="_blank">this crazy experiment</a> a reality.</p> 

My graduate work so far has been focused on evaluating nEXO's cosmogenic backgrounds, developing simulations of its outer detector (muon veto system), and assessing the feasibilty of using nEXO as a supernova neutrino observatory. I do this by developing Geant4 Monte Carlo studies; writing C++/Python code. </p>

									What we are looking at here is the pattern of light you would recieve from (only) muon Cherenkov radiation deep underground in a cylindrical water tank. The x-axis in the plot above is the unwrapped wall of a cylinder (angular direction), and the y-axis is the height of the cylinder. 
                                                                </p>

								<p>
								I was curious about what this pattern would look like with high-statistics (light from many muons superimposed). I found running these sorts of simulations in Geant4 very time-consuming because of the amount of detailed physics included (and having to use C++/ROOT). I also had a computational physics class project to do around the same time so I figured I would hit two birds with one stone. I spent a couple of days building the code that produced the plot you see above. I used the Numba package in Python to try out JIT-compiling (which is awesome) and GPU-accelerating (or even just parallelizing) my photon propagation/ray tracing. </p>
								
								<p>The physics is pretty straightforward, first you calculate the muon angular distribution you would expect at a certain depth underground (get this from the literature). Then, you generate muons with this distribution passing through your cylinder. Next, code up the angles that Cherenkov light is emitted at within the wavelength range you are interested in (remember to normalize how many photons you produce properly). Finally, run the code and calculate which photon trajectories will intersect the cylinder and at which points (TBT intro linear algerbra). At the end, superimpose the results from many muons.  
								</p>

								<p>
								The streaks on the walls happen when muons exit (their Cherenkov cone shrinks as they approach the wall). You can even modify the code to include objects (produce shadows), reflections, scattering etc... It's all really beautiful when done in Python.

So me, a postdoc and another grad student decided to switch off all the lights, and spray some liquid nitrogen vapour around the optical setup I was working on at the time. The lenses and mirrors I was alligning are on motorized stages (built by another group member) that is computer controlled by code (written by an undergrad). The laser is following a path such that it is focused inside yet another graduate student's vaccuum chamber. Truly a group effort!

								nEXO has to be placed deep underground so that the rock above it can shield the experiment from cosmic backgrounds. Still, protons and other particles reaching Earth from outer space interact with atmospheric particles and produce very high energy muons. These muons experience relativistic time dialation and can reach nEXO deep underground. The muons can produce showers of secondary particles along their track as they interact with nearby nuclei, and some of these secondary particles (e.g. neutrons) can produce a constant background to nEXO. I study which particles are produced by the muon track, and simulate their effects in our detector. I do this using Geant4, a Monte Carlo framework. </p>
								<p>To mitigate these cosmogenic backgrounds, a large water tank surrounds nEXO called the Outer Detector. This Outer Detector is instrumentated with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which can detect the Cherenkov radiation coming off the nearby underground muons. I started the simulation model, and simulated the properties of light in the Outer Detector as well as electronic response of the PMTs.

								<h2 class="">Detecting Supernova Neutrinos with nEXO</h2>
                                                                <p>Back to <a href="#research">Research page</a>.</p>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/nEXO-SN.png">
								</span>
								<p>When a very massive star runs out of nuclear fuel at the end of its life, its core collapses and the star explodes in what is called a core-collapse supernova. These events are incredibly bright, and often the dying star outshines its host galaxy before turning into a neutron star or black hole. The very exotic matter that exists in this ultra-dense environment is interesting to study but difficult to probe. Neutrinos are emitted during the ~10s of seconds around core collapse and are suspected to be heavily involved in the explosion mechanism. Ultra-low background detectors such as nEXO are able to detect these neutrinos from supernovae in our galaxy, the Milky Way at a rate of about 1 per century.</p>
								<p>
								The neutrinos coming from these events are interesting for many reasons including: 
								
								<ol>
									<li><u>The different neutrino flavours will have different energy spectra</u></li>
									which tells us about the density of different types of matter as a function of stellar radius. <br><br>
									<li><u>The time-evolution of the neutrinos tell you about the collapse process</u></li>
									including the cooling of neutron stars, and whether or not a black hole was formed.<br>
									<br>
									<li><u>The neutrinos actually arrive on Earth before the light from the supernova</u></li>
									This is because the neutrinos are extremely weakly interacting, and stop scattering much sooner than photons do. It is <i>not</i> because they are travelling faster than light, but because light has to bump around so much before reaching Earth. 
								</ol>
								
								<p>The neutrinos from a supernova give us the best time estimate for the moment of core collapse, which could be useful for gravitational wave searches (narrows down time window to look for excess power), and potentially to help triangulate the supernova and point telescopes toward that region of the sky to catch first light: UV/X-ray shock breakout; here is a <a href="docs/Al_Kharusi_mock-Chandra-proposal.pdf" target="_blank" title="Soud's mock Chandra proposal (pdf)">mock Chandra proposal</a> I wrote on catching X-ray shock breakout (for the 2019 PHYS 645 telescope allocation committee).									</p>
								All these things make neutrinos super interesting from a supernova physics perspective, but the reason they are interesting (weakly interacting) is also why they are so hard to detect. This is why there is an international consortium of many low-background, neutrino and dark maatter experiments searching for the next supernova collectively as part of the <a href="https://snews.bnl.gov/" target="_blank">SNEWS Collaboration</a>. I have thought about what nEXO can bring to SNEWS, as well as how SNEWS can make supernova detection in nEXO easier. 
								</p>

								<p>
The main neutrino interaction that I am interested in is inverse-beta decay and trying to tag detections of resultant Cherenkov photons from positron energy loss in water.
My study attempts to determine the optimal PMT set up, water composition, and analysis algorithms in order to catch these events in our detector. You can find my first poster <a href="docs/SNEWS_CASCA_poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am also interested in investigating the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) channel in liquid xenon, an  important neutral current  (flavour blind) neutrino signal. Currently, I am trying to assess the feasibility of a direct trigger from  nEXO's charge readout versus one that is external to our TPC (e.g. from SNEWS or from the Outer Detector).

								<p>Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are novel light detection devices that are gaining some traction in the particle physics community. </p>
								<p> SiPMs have single-photon counting capabilities, and can provide for excellent timing and energy resolution. For nEXO, many fo the complications come from wavelength sensitivity. Liquid xenon scintillates at a wavelength around 178 nm, deep in the vaccuum ultraviolet. These photons are generally quite difficulat to detect, but still many companies have made great progress on this front. In the lab, I've worked on setups to help with SiPM testing and characterize their response to light. This work is still relatively new to me, so I will update this page with more details in due time!

									When energy is deposited in liquid Xe-136, it produces scintillation light at ~178 nm. This is what the photodectors in the nEXO time-projection chamber need to be sensitive to. To test and characterize potential photodetectors (SiPMs in our case), we developed an electroluminescent light source (ELS) that produces light at nearly the same wavelength as the scintillation light (you cannot buy an LED/laser that produces 178 nm light!).
								</p>

								<p>
									We drift electrons through Xe gas from a silver cathode. As the electrons drift through the gas, they excite Xe atoms, these atoms then de-excite emitting electroluminescent light at ~172 nm. The electron bunches need to be controlled so that predictible and stable light output can be produced from the setup. </p>

								<p>
									I worked on developing an avalanche transistor circuit to pulse a UV LED (265 nm) that shines ~10 ns pulses on the silver cathode producing the photoelectron bunches.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scintblock.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Here we used the 265 nm LED (bottom right) to pulse directly into a block of organic scintillator. The block is made of transparent, colourless plastic. When UV light shines on it, the molecules in the block excite and de-excite (scintilate) emitting visible (blue) light out! This is similar to what we are doing with the Xe in the ELS and nEXO.</figcaption></span>

									Quasars are supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Matter surrounding the quasar accretes onto the black hole forming a a disc which can reach very high temperatures. Sometimes this process can produce jets that emit enourmous amounts of energy; often outshining their entire host galaxies.
								</p>

								<p>
									Changing look quasars (CLQs) are black holes which seem to go from on (high accretion rate) to off (low accretion rate) or vice versa on timescales as short as 10 years. The mechanism for this change of state is unknown. During the last term of my undergrad, I worked with Maclean Rouble under the supervision of Dr. John Ruan and Prof. Daryl Haggard to develop a method to find more of these CLQ objects.
								</p>

								<p>
									We decided to look at archival SDSS catalogues of quasars and galaxies and cross reference them with objects found in WISE satelite data, paying attention to their infrared 'colour' (difference in magnitude between two WISE bands).
								</p>

								<p>
									On the left of the figure above, we see that the galaxy and quasar groups have a large crossover. Then, we apply extreme deconvolution gaussian mixture modelling (XDGMM) to generate a sample data set which simulates a much higher signal to noise ratio (see figure on the top right). We then began to outline an algorithm to identify likely CLQ candidate objects.

								<h2 id="neutrino">Neutrinos </h2>
								<p>
									Neutrinos are fundamental particles in the Standard Model of Particle Physics
									(i.e. they can't be made up of other things - unlike how an atom is made of protons, electrons, neutrons etc...)
									They come in three flavours, the electron, muon and tau flavours which all have different masses.
									Neutrinos are a member of the same family of particles as an electron, known as leptons, except that they weigh less than one millionth of an electron mass and have no electric charge.
									The lack of charge makes them interesting because it opens up the possibility that they are their own antiparticle.
								</p>
								<p>
										Every particle we know of that makes up the matter around us has an associated antiparticle, which has the same mass but has the opposite charge.
										For example, an electron, which is negatively charged, has a positron as its antiparticle.
										A positron weighs and looks the same as an electron but has a positive charge.
										Because the neutrino is neutral, we don't know whether or not it is its own antiparticle yet.
										One of the best ways to confirm this is to check whether <a href="#0nbb">neutrinoless double beta decay</a> exists.
								</p>


								<li><a href="#blurb">Back to the top</a></li><br>

								<h2 id="0nbb">Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay </h2>
								<p>
									When a radioactive decay happens in a nucleus (e.g. alpha, beta, gamma radiation) there are certain laws that must be conserved.
									One of these laws is lepton number conservation.

									Beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proton, an electron and and (anti) electron neutrino. Note the anti...

									Double beta decay is when two neutrons simultaneously change into two protons, two electrons and 2 (anti) electron neutrinos...
									Notice that for every lepton (electron) you make, you also get the corresponding anti-neutrino? That's because of lepton number conservation.
								</p>
								<p>
										Hypothesis: we may be able to detect neutrinoless double beta decay...
										This means two neutrons turn into two protons + two electrons but <i>no neutrinos</i> are emitted, i.e. they cancelled eachother out because they are their own antiparticle.
										This breaks lepton number conservation and we've just created more matter than antimatter (whaaaaaat?!).
								</p>
								<p>
									Our universe is made of matter, but when you make mass out of energy (E = mc<sup>2</sup>), we have to make equal amounts of matter and antimatter.
									So how did we end up here with only matter around us?
									Maybe the neutrino is it's own antiparticle and neutrinoless double beta decays allow for a pathway to leptogenesis (creation of leptons, not antileptons) in the early universe!
								</p>

								<p>
									nEXO, the collaboration I am apart of, tries to detect this decay in xenon-136.
								</p>

								<h2 id="supernova">Dying Stars and Supernovae </h2>
								<p>
									Stars can get very, very <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEheh1BH34Q" target = "_blank">big</a>.
									The largest of these stars explode in what is called a supernova (specifically, of Type II). 
								</p>

								<p>At the end of their lives,
									stars run out of nuclei to fuse in their cores, they 'run out of fuel'. The fusion reactions that once radiated energy
									outwards stop happening and so there is no longer anything pushing back against the immense gravitational pull inwards - they're just too heavy!
									When this happens, the star's core collapses and we are left with two possibilities:
									<ol>
										<li>The star turns into a neutron star (somewhat like a giant nucleus)</li>
										<li>The star turns into a black hole</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									In either case, this process emits an incredibly bright flash of light.
									Alongside this flash, as the electrons crash into the nuclei of all the atoms in the star there is a HUGE burst of neutrinos.
									Studying the energies, arrival time, and flavour composition of these neutrinos, we can learn so much about the exotic physics of the universe under these extreme (and rare) conditions.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href=https://what-if.xkcd.com/73 target="blank">XKCD Plug</a>: A Type II supernova happens at a distance of the sun, and a nuclear bomb explodes in front of your eyeball. Which is brighter to look at? <br><br> The supernova. It'd be about 1 billion times brighter. For persepctive, looking at the sun on a cloudless day is only ~42 times brighter than the average candle held 1 cm from your pupil.

								<h2 id="MMA">Multimessenger Astronomy </h2>
								<p><i>
									Imagine living in a world where you could only see but not hear.
									Wouldn't suddenly being able to hear teach you so much about things you thought you already knew?
								</p></i>
								<p>
									Most of astronomy is is done by detecting electronmagnetic (EM) radiation from objects in space.
									Visible light is one catagory of EM radiation, but there isn't anything special about it other than the fact that most of us can see it with our eyes.
									Other examples of EM radiation include UV, X-rays, microwaves and radio.
								</p>

								<p>
									Multimessenger astronomy is about detecting events with things other than our good old friend EM radiation.
									Some examples of this include: gravitational waves and neutrinos!
									Examples of events that produce gravitational waves are: two black holes merging into one, neutron stars merging etc...
									Essentially, you need <i>very</i> massive objects to move <i>very</i> fast to be able to produce detectablegravitational waves.
									<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">LIGO</a> is at the forefront of this search.
								</p>
								<p>
									We can detect supernovae in our galaxy through neutrinos, if the supernova is asymmetric (the collapse is non-spherical) we may even be able to even detect gravitational waves from the same event! This is the focus of my work.

								<p>As mentioned previously, I am now a graduate student at McGill University.
									However, I also did my undergraduate degree here. During that time, I was heavily involved in student politics and event planning.
									Now, I've decided to chill and focus more on my work and music.</p>

								<p>If you haven't guessed already, I currently reside in MontrÃ©al, Canada, a beautiful multicultural city in QuÃ©bec.
								In May 2018, I had the pleasure of having my wonderful friend Lauren Nagel and the <a href="https://mcgillflyingclub.com/"> McGill Students Flying Club</a> fly me around town!

								<h3>Things I do outside of physics </h3> <br>
								<h3>Music </h3>
								<p>I play/make music, usually on the guitar. You can check out one of my (really old) originals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTYZo7i8w4"target="_blank"> here</a>
									 which was written with my good friend, Mohammed Al Maameri.
									 This summer I've gotten into making <i>very</i> basic electronic music on a midi keyboard while trying to reconnect with my ~piano~ roots.
									 More recently, I picked up the ukelele while in Hawaii and taught myself a few songs.</p>
								<p>Some of my biggest influences include: <br>
									Red Hot Chili Peppers/John Frusciante <br> Radiohead <br> Daft Punk <br> Muse</p>

								<h3>Snowboarding </h3>
								<p>I taught myself to snowboard in Eastern Canada/US during my second winter here, having embedded myself in a group of friends that went often. Hit me up if you want to carpool or <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj2eGCYwgsc&t=1s"></a>learn!</p>

								<h3>Photography </h3>
								<p>I started to dabble in astrophotography/photography for a bit before leaving Oman, trying to learn from <a href="http://samirkharusi.net/" target = "_blank">my dad</a>.
									Here is a photo I took of M42 - the Great Nebula in Orion from our rooftop back home.
									By the way, the images you'll find on my site were all taken by me unless stated otherwise, so please credit them!</p>

								<h4> Who says animals don't have feelings?</h4>
								<p>
									I was walking around Lac aux Castors, Beaver Lake, on top of Mount Royal on a cold spring(?) morning when I witnessed a fantastic natural occurence happen in front of me: I watched a seagull snatch a fish out of the lake. I quickly pulled out my phone to snap a photo.
								</p>

								<p>
									As I was doing this, another seagull swooped in and stole the goldfish form the first one.
